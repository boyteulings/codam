# Piscine at Codam

This is the repository for my Piscine in July 2021 at Codam in Amsterdam, a programming school from the 42 network of schools that originated in Paris.
The Piscine is a sort of test that lasts for a full month, and 7 days per week where you get to experience how the school works and take your first steps in programming in C.
It was a tough month but also very fun and I've had the pleasure of meeting a lot of great people! I could recommend it to anyone who's thinking about starting with programming.

Since I got accepted into Codam I've continued using this repository for all my work at Codam, both personal experiments and school projects.
